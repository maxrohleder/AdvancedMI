## Project Architecture

This project is (as outlined before) structured into backend and front end. The used software stack is described in [Architecture](architecture.md). 

There is one flask-based webserver, which exposes the administrative functionality of the project via a REST-Api. The sources for these backend functions can be found in the folder `./backend`.

The client side of the application was written using React. The code can be seen in the folder called `./frontend`.
